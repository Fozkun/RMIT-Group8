<td>Farhan Alkarim Sofjan</td>
<td>My name is Farhan, I do not have an English name 
    because we do not use English names where I am from (Indonesia). 
    I am a first year at RMIT Vietnam and moved to Ho Chi Minh City last year in September. 
    I have been enjoying the country so far, mainly for its food. I have had 
    some experience in IT in high school making projects like creating 
    webpage on WordPress and making a management system using Microsoft Access
    if I remember correctly. As I do find IT interesting and feel like I have learned 
    quite a lot of interesting things in this major, I will soon be switching my major 
    to Design Studies next semester because art is actually my greatest passion.
