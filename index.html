<td>Farhan Alkarim Sofjan</td>
<td>My name is Farhan, I do not have an English name 
    because we do not use English names where I am from (Indonesia). 
    I am a first year at RMIT Vietnam and moved to Ho Chi Minh City last year in September. 
    I have been enjoying the country so far, mainly for its food. I have had 
    some experience in IT in high school making projects like creating 
    webpage on WordPress and making a management system using Microsoft Access
    if I remember correctly. As I do find IT interesting and feel like I have learned 
    quite a lot of interesting things in this major, I will soon be switching my major 
    to Design Studies next semester because art is actually my greatest passion. </td>

    <td> Nguyen Minh Tri</td>
    <td>Hello, my name is Tri, my English name is Fozkun and I am from Vietnam. 
        I like programming, analyzing data and IT stuff which makes me enroll 
        in an IT course because I am able to know basic and advanced knowledge 
        about IT such as GitHub, Linux commands, permissions, etc. I was born 
        in Ho Chi Minh city and live near RMIT university, so it usually takes 
        me 20 minutes to get there by bike. I love going to university early 
        because I have time to prepare my projects and wander around. I love 
        my team and I am in charge of coding the HTML website.

    <td>Nguyen Kim An</td>
    <td>My name is Kim Anh. I am in my first semester here at RMIT. 
        The reason I chose IT major is because I like the idea of 
        making and building things from scratches. Prior to this 
        course, I did not have too much experience in the IT 
        field except for using daily computer necessities. 
        My hobbies include practicing yoga, reading magazines 
        and books, and listening to music. Through this 
        course, I have found some interesting things to 
        learn more about what expected in the field.

    <td>Nguy Cao Tuan Duc</td>
    <td>My name is Tuan Duc, I have an interest with computers 
        and technology in general so I chose to study IT. 
        I have a moderate understanding of coding and other 
        concepts around it but through this course I am able 
        to understand more about it and learnt a lot of new 
        things. I spend my free time either playing video 
        games, editing a video or coding on some personal 
        projects. I am from Hanoi so moving into Saigon 
        living and studying is a bit overwhelming at first 
        but I got the hang of it now.
